# MakeLobbiesGreatAgain
MLGA is a tool for Dead By Daylight which checks the provided network interface for packets coming from Dead By Daylight's lobby joining. 
Once detected, the tool will lookup the killer's IP and return the country code through the command prompt and a dialog popup if the killer is outside of the specified regions.

## TODO
* Make regions selectable, rather than hardcoded
* Make the dialog box optional
* Provide a network device input, rather than the hardcoded IP address.
