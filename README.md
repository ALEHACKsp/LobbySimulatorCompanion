MLGA is a tool for Dead By Daylight which checks the provided network interface for packets coming from Dead By Daylight's lobby joining. 
Once detected, the tool will lookup the killer's IP and return the country code in a transparent overlay.

The overlay is draggable by double-clicking to unlock/lock it.

To exit, there's an icon with Jake's face on the system tray, which can be right-clicked to exit.
